# SSZ Overview

<br/>
<br/>

### This is an overview of the SSZ Specifications
#### The raw specs can be found [here](#/specs).

<br/>

##### SSZ was created to standardize serialization for data for Eth2
##### It improves upon older formats by including `Merkleization` functionality resulting in smaller, more succint proofs.
##### The main use-case of SSZ is to provide a consistent encoding and merkleization framework for the core of the Eth2 protocol.
##### However, use outside of the core protocol, such as in smart contracts or layer-2 solutions, is also considered and factored into the design.

<br/>

###### This is NOT official documentation for SSZ-SimpleSerialize. This is an interpretation and expansion on the official specifications. The content here is a living, open-source, collaborative resource, built upon the orginial inspiration for SSZ, as well as the experience of the community of developers implementing SSZ in their work
