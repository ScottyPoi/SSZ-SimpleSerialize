###### SSZ was created to standardize serialization for data for Eth2

- It improves upon older formats by including `Merkleization` functionality resulting in smaller, more succint proofs.
- The main use-case of SSZ is to provide a consistent encoding and merkleization framework for the core of the Eth2 protocol.
- However, use outside of the core protocol, such as in smart contracts or layer-2 solutions, is also considered and factored into the design.
